		<h2>Creation and Destruction of Objects</h2>
		<p>In Birch, objects are created by the code</p>
			<pre>const object = system.createObject();</pre>
		<p>and destroyed by the code</p>
			<pre>system.destroyObject(object);</pre>
		<h2>The Render System</h2>
		<h3>Mesh</h3>
		<p>The mesh defines the positions, normals, uvs, and other vertex properties, as well as the primitives such as triangles, lines, or points that make up a mesh.</p>
		<p>A mesh is created and destroyed by</p>
		<pre>const mesh = birch.render.meshes.create();</pre>
		<pre>birch.render.meshes.destroy(mesh);</pre>
		<p>The mesh can be points, lines, or triangles, which you can set via</p>
		<pre>mesh.setPrimitiveType('points');</pre>
		<pre>mesh.setPrimitiveType('lines');</pre>
		<pre>mesh.setPrimitiveType('triangles');</pre>
		<p>The mesh supports multiple vertex arrays, interleaved arrays, and any combination thereof. You can set the format of the vertices by</p>

		<h2>Rationales</h2>
		<h3>Null vs Undefined</h3>
			<p>This has been a tough question for me. I don't want to intermix null and undefined, and want to be consistent throughout the code base.</p>
			<p>I've decided to use only undefined for these reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Optional parameters and destructured parameters default to undefined.</li>
				<li>Map.get and other ES6 features use undefined.</li>
				<li>The distinction between a property existing and being undefined is moot in Typescript and JSON, since they have proper type checks.</li>
				<li>Arithmetic works well: 4 + undefined = NaN.</li>
				<li>typeof a === 'undefined' (not 'object' as with null)</li>
			</ul>

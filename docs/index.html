	<h2>Creation and Destruction of Objects</h2>
	<p>In Birch, objects are created by the pattern</p>
	<pre>const object = system.objects.create();</pre>
	<p>and destroyed by the pattern</p>
	<pre>system.objects.destroy(object);</pre>
	<p>Every object has a <code>destroy</code> function, which is invoked when the object is destroyed by the pattern above.</p>
	<h2>Systems</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="render.html">Render</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Rationales</h2>
	<h3>Null vs Undefined</h3>
	<p>This has been a tough question for me. I don't want to intermix null and undefined, and want to be consistent throughout the code base.</p>
	<p>I've decided to use only undefined for these reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Optional parameters and destructured parameters default to undefined.</li>
		<li>Map.get and other ES6 features use undefined.</li>
		<li>The distinction between a property existing and being undefined is moot in Typescript and JSON, since they have proper type checks.</li>
		<li>Arithmetic works well: 4 + undefined = NaN.</li>
		<li>typeof a === 'undefined' (not 'object' as with null)</li>
	</ul>

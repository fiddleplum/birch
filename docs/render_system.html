	<h2>The Render System</h2>
	<p>The render system is a self contained WebGL renderer. It has the following classes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href='#mesh'>Mesh</a> - The vertices and primitives of an object.</li>
		<li><a href="#shader">Shader</a> - The GLSL code of an object.</li>
		<li><a href="texture">Texture</a> - The image applied to an object.</li>
		<li><a href="uniforms">Uniforms</a> - The specific values and textures to apply to an object.</li>
		<li><a href="model">Model</a> - An object, combining a mesh, a shader, and uniforms.</li>
		<li><a href="scene">Scene</a> - A set of models to be rendered.</li>
		<li><a href="stage">Stage</a> - A view of a scene.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="mesh">Mesh</h2>
	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>The mesh defines the positions, normals, uvs, and other vertex properties, as well as the primitives such as triangles, lines, or points that make up a mesh.</p>
	<p>A mesh is created and destroyed by:</p>
	<p class="code">const mesh = birch.render.meshes.create();</p>
	<p class="code">birch.render.meshes.destroy(mesh);</p>
	<h3>Setting the Format</h3>
	<p>The mesh primitives can be points, lines, or triangles, which you can set via:</p>
	<p class="code">mesh.setPrimitiveType('points');</p>
	<p class="code">mesh.setPrimitiveType('lines');</p>
	<p class="code">mesh.setPrimitiveType('triangles');</p>
	<p>The mesh supports multiple vertex arrays, interleaved arrays, and any combination thereof. You can set the format of the vertices by:</p>
	<p class="code">
		mesh.setVertexFormat([[{
			location: 0, // position
			type: 'float',
			dimensions: 3
		}, {
			location: 1, // uv
			type: 'float',
			dimensions: 2
		}], [{
			location: 2, // color
			type: 'float',
			dimensions: 4
		}]);
	</p>
	<p>This code would create two vertex arrays with one containing the position and uv, and the other containing the color. This setup could be handy if you were updating the color frequently but not the other components.</p>
	<p>The location values must match the locations specified in the shader's attributeLocations property.</p>
	<h3>Setting the Vertices and Primitives</h3>
	<p>Initializing the vertices and indices is usually the most complicated part of setting up a mesh. It can be as simple as setting arrays or a complex algorithm. To setup a simple square using the above attributes in the x-y plane, you can do:</p>
	<p class="code">
		const vertices0: number[] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0];
		const vertices1: number[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1];
		const indices: number[] = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0];
		mesh.setVertices(0, vertices0, false);
		mesh.setVertices(1, vertices1, false);
		mesh.setIndices(indices, false);
	</p>
	<p>Since in the previous code we set up two vertex arrays, <code>vertices0</code> contains the position and uv attributes as a single array of floats (3 for position and 2 for uv, repeating for each of the 4 vertices), and <code>vertices1</code> similarly contains the color attribute as a single array of floats (4 for color, repeating 4 times).</p>
	<p>The indices describe which vertices are used to make the primitives. In this example the primitives are triangles, so every three numbers describes a triangle with those vertices as points.</p>
	<p>The last parameter of the <code>setVertices</code> statements is used to indicate whether or not the vertex points will be updated frequently (i.e. every frame) or not. And the last parameter of the <code>setIndices</code> indices whether or not to use 32-bit indices, which is needed if there are more than 2^16 vertices used.</p>
	<h3>Instancing</h3>
	<p>Sometimes you may want to reuse the same set of vertices many times while varying a single attribute. For instance, what if we want to make many squares, each with a different position, but not have to repeat the same vertices over and over?</p>
	<p>First, let's change the color attribute to be an <code>offset</code> with 3 components:</p>
	<p class="code">
		...
		}], [{
			location: 2, // offset
			type: 'float',
			dimensions: 3
		}]);
	</p>
	<p>Then the <code>vertices1</code> array could be a list of arbitrary offsets:</p>
	<p class="code">
		const vertices1: number[] = [4, 5, 1, -2, 4, 5, 3, -8, 10, 7, -1, 0, 8, 9, 1];
		mesh.setVertices(1, vertices1, true);
	</p>
	<p>Notice that we said <code>true</code> for the last parameter of <code>setVertices</code>, which means that every vertex in <code>vertices1</code> will be used once per instance instead of once per vertex. This means that for every instance that is drawn, the first offset ([4, 5, 1] in this case) will be used for every vertex in the first instance, and then the second offset ([-2, 4, 5]) will be used in the second instance, and so on, up to 5 instances.</p>
	<p>To specify how many instances to draw, you can do:</p>
	<p class="code">
		mesh.setNumInstances(5);
	</p>
	<p>Usually it is the number of vertices in the instanced attribute, but can be less as well.</p>
